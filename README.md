# Investigate-Hotel-Business-using-Data-Visualization

The dataset contains data from two different hotels. One Resort hotel and one City hotel. Both hotels are located in Indonesia.

Topics covered and questions to answer from the data are:

    1. When the best time of year to book a hotel room is?
    2. Does stay duration has an impact on hotel bookings cancellation rates?
    3. Does lead time on hotel bookings has an impact on bookings cancellation rate?

From the analysis, we can answered that:
1. Both Hotels have more guests during holiday season

- Both types of hotels get the highest number of bookings around June and July. This time coincided with the Hari Raya holidays and school holidays in Indonesia.

- In other months that do not coincide with any holiday, bookings are seen much lower. So that for Urban Hotels experienced a significant decline in August and September.

-Both types of hotels have a positive trend, the longer the duration of the stay, the higher the probability of the booking being cancelled.

- The lowest booking cancellation rate is for bookings with a waiting time of less than 30 days and applies to both types of hotels.
