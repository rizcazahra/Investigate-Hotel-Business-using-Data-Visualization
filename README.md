# Investigate-Hotel-Business-using-Data-Visualization

The dataset contains data from two different hotels. One Resort hotel and one City hotel.

From the publication (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352340918315191) we know that both hotels are located in Portugal (southern Europe) ("H1 at the resort region of Algarve and H2 at the city of Lisbon"). The distance between these two locations is ca. 280 km by car and both locations border on the north atlantic.

The data contains "bookings due to arrive between the 1st of July of 2015 and the 31st of August 2017".
Note: For most questions I will only use bookings that were not canceled, to get acutal guest numbers. As you will see, this is quite a big difference.

Topics covered and questions to answer from the data:

    1. When the best time of year to book a hotel room is?
    2. Does stay duration has an impact on hotel bookings cancellation rates?
    3. Does lead time on hotel bookings has an impact on bookings cancellation rate?
